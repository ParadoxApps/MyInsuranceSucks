	  <p class="text-center col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
	  	So here's how it works. With the current health insurance system, costs have skyrocketed, leaving us with little to no options. But the co-op health care method is a great alternative to health insurance. Lose the middle man, and we can save a lot of money.

	  <p class="col-md-10">
	  	Tens of thousands of us are already using co-ops and most of the co-op organizations have been around for over 20 years. This is a health care option that has stood the test of time. We've relied on big insurance companies and beaurocracies long enough. It's time we put our confidence into organizations that are trustworthy and based on real community.

	  	No Government Penalties
	  </h2>
	  <p class="col-md-10">
	  	Starting in 2014, the new law requires individuals to purchase health insurance or pay a penalty. However, the PPACA law also contains a provision that members of health care sharing plans are not subject to the insurance requirement, and they are exempt from the penalties.  Therefore, the new law does not hinder current or new members from participating.
